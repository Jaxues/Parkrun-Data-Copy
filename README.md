# Parkrun-Data-Copy
Copy of Group project I did for DATA201 written in R focused on analysis of Parkrun data

For the project I did:
- Webscraping week from parkrun html
- Create log linear regression for data based of geographic distance
- Calculated simple table for mean number of people at locations

For my work I got 88% on the project.
A grade I am very happy with.
